                    <p class="w3-center">Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United States&period; While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds&comma; care and diet can differ between breeds&period; However&comma; some diets and practices are generally recommended for the well&nbdash; being of your fluffy family member regardless of breed&period;

                        <h2>Zero to Four Weeks</h2>
                        <p>It is important the queen &lpar;a term commonly used for a female cat that is either pregnant or nursing&rpar; directly nurse her young if possible&period; Monitor your kitten&apos;s growth closely to make sure its growth rate is progressing steadily&period; If any kitten is not growing at a sufficient rate&comma; a caretaker might need to feed the kitten directly either with a bottle or a feeding tube&period; Some reasons why kittens might not gain weight appropriately include the following&colon;
                    <ul>    
                        <li>too many other siblings are competing for mom's milk</li>
                        <li>gastrointestinal disease</li>
                    	 <li>environmental conditions such as extreme heat or cold, or unsanitary conditions</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2>Four Weeks to One Year</h2>
                    <p>Kittens can start being introduced to soft wet kitten food typically around three to four weeks after birth&period; According to the ASPCA&comma; kittens at this age should eat half to one cup of dry kitten food or six to nine ounces of wet kitten food per day&period; If your kitten has difficulties eating hard food&comma; a small amount of water can be added to soften the food&period; Cat food that is optimized for kittens provides the additional nutrients that are needed for growth&comma; energy&comma; and wellness&period; Depending on the breed&comma; your cat may have different dietary requirements&period; You should always consult with your veterinarian for recommendations&period;
                        </p>
                        <h2>One Year to Seven Years</h2>
                        <p>This age is when kittens reach the cat stage and do not need as many nutrients&period; At this age&comma; their level of activity decreases&comma; and so does their metabolism&period; It is not recommended to leave food out for the cats all day&period; Instead&comma; provide food a couple times a day so they eat meals rather than snacking throughout the day&period; This practice reduces the risk of obesity and other weight-related feline ailments&period;
                        
                        <h2>Seven Years and More</h2>
                        <p>Much like many living organisms&comma; the body begins to deteriorate and experience a lot of changes&period; Cats at this age should eat less fats and calories and more quality proteins&period; This means when you are purchasing packaged foods for your cat&comma; look for food that states a particular protein &lpar;such as &ldquot;salmon&rdquot;&rpar; and not just a category &lpar;such as fish&rpar;&period; This usually means they are byproducts&comma; or combinations&comma; of lesser quality proteins&period;
